/**
 * Reads `body` to completion and discards it.
 *
 * Cancelling a request body the client is still streaming resets the request
 * stream. Firefox surfaces that to the caller as NS_ERROR_NET_PARTIAL_TRANSFER
 * even when the response is a success, so any path that returns 2xx while the
 * upload is still in flight must drain instead of cancel. Rejection paths
 * should keep cancelling — accepting bytes only to throw them away is worse.
 *
 * Draining costs the inbound bandwidth. Clients that want to avoid the transfer
 * altogether should preflight with HEAD /upload (BUD-06).
 *
 * Never throws: a client vanishing mid-drain is not worth failing a response
 * that has already been decided.
